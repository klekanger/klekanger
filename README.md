# Hi, welcome to my repo! ðŸ¤“

I'm a self-taught developer who works as a senior communications advisor at Iteo.no. I have more than 30 years experience as an IT journalist and editor (PC World, Tek.no, Digi.no, DN.no), and have been interested in coding since I got my first computer - a Commodore 64. Actually, I got my first job by writing a 6510 assembly course for a computer magazine, and did some hobby projects in Turbo Pascal and C during the late 80s and early 90s. Good times...

In 2018 i wanted to pick up programming again, and I set a goal for myself to learn as much as I could about modern web development, with focus on Javascript, HTML, CSS and modern frameworks like React.js. I spent a couple of hours every day while commuting, in addition to weekends and holidays, trying to learn as much as possible. A lot of courses, both beginner and advanced. I also finished the MIT 6.00x computer science course, with focus on data structures and algorithms (mostly in Python).

I have good skills in vanilla Javascript and Node.js, HTML and CSS. However, I have focused mostly on React.js - and React based frameworks like Gatsby.js and Next.js. I've worked mostly on the frontend, but have a good understanding of the backend - and have set up servers and APIs in Node.js (with Express) or as serverless functions in AWS Lambda or Netlify Functions. 

## My latest project
My biggest project so far has been to build a web site for my local housing association ([you can see it here - https://gartnerihagen-askim.no](https://gartnerihagen-askim.no/). It's built with React/Gatsby.js, Contentful (as a headless CMS), Chakra UI and with Auth0 authentication to protect private routes of the web site. You can [read about it on my personal blog](https://www.lekanger.no/project/del-1-slik-bygget-jeg-nye-nettsider-til-sameiet-med-gatsby-og-chakra-ui) (in Norwegian).
