# Hi, welcome to my Github! ðŸ¤“

I'm a journalist and developer who works as a journalist at Norway's #1 news site for developers, [kode24.no](https://kode24.no). I have more than 30 years experience as an IT journalist and editor (PC World, Tek.no, Digi.no, DN.no), and have also experience as a senior communications advisor and content producer. 

I have been interested in coding since I got my first computer - a Commodore 64. Actually, I got my first job by writing a 6510 assembly course for a computer magazine, and did some hobby projects in Turbo Pascal and C during the late 80s and early 90s. Good times...

Now I'm coding in Javascript, TypeScript, HTML and CSS â€“ sometimes trying out new programming languages like Swift. I have focused mostly on React.js - and React based frameworks like Next.js. 

I am also building web sites for clients through my own company [_Lekanger tekst og kode_](https://www.lekanger.no)
