# Hi, welcome to my Github! ðŸ¤“

I'm a self-taught developer who works as a journalist at Norway's #1 news site for developers, [kode24.no](https://kode24.no). I have more than 30 years experience as an IT journalist and editor (PC World, Tek.no, Digi.no, DN.no), and have also experience as a senior communications advisor and content producer. 

I have been interested in coding since I got my first computer - a Commodore 64. Actually, I got my first job by writing a 6510 assembly course for a computer magazine, and did some hobby projects in Turbo Pascal and C during the late 80s and early 90s. Good times...

I have good skills in vanilla Javascript, TypeScript and Node.js, HTML and CSS. I have focused mostly on React.js - and React based frameworks like Gatsby.js and Next.js. I've worked mostly on the frontend, but have a good understanding of the backend. I have experience with headless CMS systems like Sanity.io, Contentful and Headless Wordpress, and have implemented authentication solutions like Auth0 as well. 

I try to keep up with modern web and application development by reading, listening to developer podcasts, participating in online web conferences, and by taking courses - like the professional and expert courses on Frontend Masters. And of course: Practicing by coding on different projects every day.

## My latest projects
My latest project was building my new personal web page at [lekanger.no](https://www.lekanger.no). I have made this with Next.js, Typescript and Sanity, with Tailwind CSS for styling. This is a monorepo using Vercel's Turborepo, and everything is deployed to Vercel (except for Sanity Studio, which is hosted at Sanity). [Have a look at the code here](https://github.com/klekanger/kurt-personal-web-2)

I have also built the web site for my local housing association (you can see it here: [https://gartnerihagen-askim.no](https://gartnerihagen-askim.no/). It's built with React/Gatsby.js, Contentful (as a headless CMS), Chakra UI and with Auth0 authentication to protect private routes of the web site. You can [read about it on my personal blog](https://www.lekanger.no/project/del-1-slik-bygget-jeg-nye-nettsider-til-sameiet-med-gatsby-og-chakra-ui) (in Norwegian). The source code is [here](https://github.com/klekanger/gartnerihagen).

Here's my take on a classic "memory game". I've called the game "Teflonhjerne" (teflon brain). The game is mostly written in TypeScript, with Vite as build tool. I've used GSAP for some animations, the rest is just JS/TS, HTML and CSS. [Try playing the game here: Teflonhjerne](https://teflonhjerne.netlify.app/) - or have a look at [the source code here](https://github.com/klekanger/teflonhjerne). The game is a PWA, which makes it installable. Known bugs: audio lag on Safari on iOS. 

Another game that's still work in progresss: [Attack of the Space Nerds](https://github.com/klekanger/attack-of-the-space-nerds). This is a 2D space shooter made in vanilla JS/TypeScript and HTML canvas. Parallax scrolling. Lots of bugs and the gameplay needs a lot of work. I made this primarily to learn some new stuff and practice my TS skills. You can play a working (?) version of the game here: **[Attack of the Space Nerds](https://attack-of-the-space-nerds.netlify.app/)
