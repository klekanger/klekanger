# Hi, welcome to my Github! ðŸ¤“

I am a journalist and developer working at Norwayâ€™s leading news site for developers, [kode24.no](https://kode24.no). With over 30 years of experience as an IT journalist and editor, Iâ€™ve contributed to renowned publications such as PC World, Tek.no, Digi.no, and DN.no. Additionally, Iâ€™ve worked as a senior communications advisor and content producer, broadening my expertise in the tech and media industries.

My passion for coding began with my first computer, a Commodore 64. In fact, I landed my first job by writing a 6510 assembly course for a computer magazine. Throughout the late â€™80s and early â€™90s, I enjoyed creating hobby projects in Turbo Pascal and C. Those were exciting days that fueled my lifelong interest in programming.

Today, my focus is on modern web development, primarily working with JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. Iâ€™ve specialized in React.js and React-based frameworks like Next.js, while occasionally experimenting with other languages, such as Swift, and frameworks like Astro, to expand my skill set.

I am also building web sites and web apps for clients through my own company [_Lekanger tekst og kode_](https://www.lekanger.no)
