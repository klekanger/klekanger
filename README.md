# Hi, welcome to my Github! ðŸ¤“

I'm a self-taught developer who works as a senior communications advisor at Iteo.no. I have more than 30 years experience as an IT journalist and editor (PC World, Tek.no, Digi.no, DN.no), and have been interested in coding since I got my first computer - a Commodore 64. Actually, I got my first job by writing a 6510 assembly course for a computer magazine, and did some hobby projects in Turbo Pascal and C during the late 80s and early 90s. Good times...

In 2018 i wanted to pick up programming again, and I set a goal for myself to learn as much as I could about modern web development, with focus on Javascript, HTML, CSS and modern frameworks like React.js. I spent a couple of hours every day while commuting, in addition to weekends and holidays, trying to learn as much as possible. A lot of courses, both beginner and advanced. I also finished the MIT 6.00x computer science course, with focus on data structures and algorithms (mostly in Python).

I have good skills in vanilla Javascript and Node.js, HTML and CSS. I have focused mostly on React.js - and React based frameworks like Gatsby.js and Next.js. I've worked mostly on the frontend, but have a good understanding of the backend - and have set up servers and APIs in Node.js (with Express) or as serverless functions in AWS Lambda or Netlify Functions. I have experience with headless CMS systems like Sanity.io, Contentful and Headless Wordpress, and have implemented authentication solutions like Auth0 as well. 

I try to keep up with modern web and application development by reading, listening to developer podcasts, participating in online web conferences, and by taking courses - like the professional and expert courses on Frontend Masters. And of course: Practicing by coding on different projects every day.

## My latest projects
My latest project is building a web site for a (at the moment) fictious company called "Lekanger tekst & kode". I have made this with Next.js, Typescript and Sanity, with Tailwind CSS for styling. [Have a look at the code here](https://github.com/klekanger/kurt-next-website)

I have also built the web site for my local housing association (you can see it here: [https://gartnerihagen-askim.no](https://gartnerihagen-askim.no/). It's built with React/Gatsby.js, Contentful (as a headless CMS), Chakra UI and with Auth0 authentication to protect private routes of the web site. You can [read about it on my personal blog](https://www.lekanger.no/project/del-1-slik-bygget-jeg-nye-nettsider-til-sameiet-med-gatsby-og-chakra-ui) (in Norwegian). The source code is [here](https://github.com/klekanger/gartnerihagen).

And last, but not least - here's my take on a classic "memory game". I've called the game "Teflonhjerne" (teflon brain). The game is mostly written in TypeScript, with Vite as build tool. I've used GSAP for some animations, the rest is just JS/TS, HTML and CSS. [Try playing the game here: Teflonhjerne](https://teflonhjerne.netlify.app/) - or have a look at [the source code here](https://github.com/klekanger/teflonhjerne). Known bug: audio lag on Safari on iOS.
